== Example using Responds To Parent and Paperclip

The problem: you are using an Ajax based dialog box. So you want to POST the
form back using Ajax but you can't because it is a multipart form with 
image uploading.

So you need to POST to a target hidden IFRAME. Problem is, the Javascript
that will come back will run inside the IFRAME.

Solution: using the responds_to_parent plugin, it will trap the returning
Javascript so it is executed in the parent window.
